<h2><small><i>by ... WILLIAM LOGAN</i></small></h2>

<p class="pr1"><b><big>Perhaps it was just as well that I did not tell them what I was....</big></b></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">What they</span> called me,
that was what started it. I'm
as good an American as the
next fellow, and maybe a little
bit better than men like
that, big men drinking in a
bar who can't find anything
better to do than to spit on a
man and call him Mex. As if
a Mexican is something to
hide or to be ashamed of. We
have our own heroes and our
own strength and we don't
have to bend down to men
like that, or any other men.
But when they called me that
I saw red and called them
names back.</p>

<p>"Mex kid," one of the men
said, a big red-haired bully
with his sleeves rolled back
and muscles like ropes on the
big hairy arms. "Snot-nosed
little Mex brat."</p>

<p>I called him a name. He
only laughed back at me and
turned his back, waving a
hand for the bartender. Maybe
in a big city in the North
it would be different and
probably it would not: this
toleration we hear about is
no more good than an open
fight, and there must be understanding
instead. But here
near the border, just on the
American side of the border,
a Mexican is called fair game,
and a seventeen-year-old like
me is less than nothing to
them, to the white ones who
go to the big bars.</p>

<p>I thought carefully about
what to do, and finally when
I had made my mind up I
went for him and tried to hit
him. But other men held me
back, and I was kicking and
shouting with my legs off the
ground. When I stopped they
put me down, so I started
for the big red-haired man
again and they had to stop
me again. The red-haired man
was laughing all this time. I
wanted to run, back to my
own family in their little
house, and yet running would
have been wrong; I was too
angry to run, so I stayed.</p>

<p>"My sister," I said. "My
sister is a witch and I will
get her to put a curse on
you." I was very angry, you
must understand this.</p>

<p>And of course they had no
idea that my sister is a real
witch, and her curses are
real, and only last year
Manuel Valdez had died
from the effects of her curse.
Of all people, sometimes I
wish I were my sister most
of all, to curse people and
see them shrivel and sicken
and choke and die.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, half-pint," one
of the other men yelled. "Get
your sister to put a curse on
me. I bet she knows who I
am; I been with every Mex
girl this side of the border."</p>

<p>This made me see red; my
sister is pure and must be
pure, since she is a witch.
And she is not like some of
the others even aside from
that. I have heard her talk
about them and I know.</p>

<p>I called him a name and
ran up to him and hit him;
my fist against his solid side
felt good, but some other men
pulled me off again. Yet it
was impossible to leave. This
was wrong for me, and I had
to make it right. "I shall get
my father to fight you, since
he is a giant ten feet tall."</p>

<p>The men laughed at me,
not knowing, of course, that
my father is a giant ten feet
tall in truth, and my mother
a sweet siren like those in
the books, the old books, with
spells in her eyes and a
strange power. They did not
know I was not a daydreaming
child but a man who told
truth.</p>

<p>And they laughed; I grew
angry again and told them
many things, calling them
names in Spanish, which they
did not understand. That only
made them laugh the more.</p>

<p>Finally I left; it was necessary
for me to leave, since I
was not wanted. But it was
necessary, too, for me to
make things right. Nights
later they were dead for what
they had said and done.</p>

<p>For I tell the truth always,
and I had told them about
my sister and my father and
my mother. But one thing I
had not told them.</p>

<p>I am sorry they could
never know I was the winged
thing that frightened and
killed them, one by one....</p>
